# Week 00 Rust: Rust toolchain verification

**Purpose**: Verify your Rust installation works

## Quick test

```bash
cd week00_rust/

# Build
cargo build

# Run
cargo run

# Test
cargo test

# Lint
cargo clippy
```

**If all commands work, your Rust setup is correct!**

This is optional for Week 00 - Rust content starts in Week 09.
